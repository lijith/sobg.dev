		<h2 class="sub-heading">Sampoorna Gita Jnana Yajnam On Doordarshan</h2>
		<p>To put in simple terms, the telecast of the Sampoorna Gita Jnana Yajnam produced by His Vision created history. Starting on 14 April 2006, this discourse series running daily  for two and a half years saw the continuous and uninterrupted telecast and re-telecast with 385 and over 400 episodes respectively. The viewership and reach of this programme have been phenomenal, extending to all parts of India and abroad and covering all sections of society, irrespective of religion or class. The daily slot of 9.30 PM to 10 PM found a permanent place in the hearts of the people who saw this series as more than an explanation of the Bhagavad Gita. It was a programme that is educational and informative, creating an awareness of the Indian heritage and culture acceptable to all citizens of the world. </p>
