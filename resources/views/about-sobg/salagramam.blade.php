		<p>The universe is made up of the five elements of space, air, fire, water and earth and every particle is a reflection thereof. Salagramam ashram represents this principle and is the confluence of the essence of the best and the highest in the universe. </p>

			<p>School of Bhagavad Gita, envisioned and founded by <strong>Swami Sandeepananda Giri</strong>, stands for the universality of the Bhagavad Gita, the spiritual heritage of India and the non-sectarian values that it propagates.</p>

			<p>A registered not-for-profit public Trust, it supports a wide range of initiatives committed to exploring Indian philosophy as a living tradition, faithful to its origins, yet compatible with today’s world.</p>

			<p>Salagramam Ashram – the Temple of Knowledge – houses the headquarters of the School of Bhagavad Gita.</p>

			<p>SAALAGRAMAM is located in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala, the beautiful southern state of India.  Built on a serene setting along the banks of the Karamana river, in Kundamankadavu, the ambience is rustic, yet close enough to the city and is easily accessible by road. Situated amidst greenery, the ashram features ethnic and eco-friendly architecture.</p>
