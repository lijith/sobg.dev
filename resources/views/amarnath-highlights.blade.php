The Shivalingam at Amarnath is formed of ice and it is popularly known as Ice lingam or Himalingam. It is believed that Lord Shiva revealed the secret of creation and immortality to Parvathi Devi in the Amarnath cave. Pilgrimage to this holy shrine is organized during the month of Sravana. Saints like Aadi Shankaracharya, Swami Vivekananda and Swami Ramtirtha have visited Amarnath. Swami Vivekananda has said, "The image was the Lord Himself. It was all worship there. I never have been to anything so beautiful, so inspiring.” </p></div>
