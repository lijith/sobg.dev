			<p>After initiating and coordinating several projects in Chinmaya Mission for about a decade, Swamiji, then known as Br. Sandeep Chaitanya, created history by conducting the 108 days continuous discourse series on the Bhagavad Gita. Held at the Vyloppilli Samskriti Bhavan Open air auditorium in Trivandrum, the event attracted a daily audience of around 2000. Swamiji’s simple explanation of the Gita, replete with examples from everyday life and laced with his inimical humour was an eye-opener for the common man.</p>

			<p>Following this up with the telecast of the complete series on ACV, this Gita Yajnam was singularly responsible for bringing the Bhagavad Gita down to the masses who, regardless of caste or creed, began to understand it clearly, accept and appreciate it whole-heartedly.</p>
