			<p>Inspired by the life and work of Swami Chinmayananda, Swamiji took up the Vedanta Course at the Chinmaya International Foundation, following which he entered monastic life in 1994 as Br. Sandeep Chaitanya in the Chinmaya Mission with a dedication to spread the spiritual legacy of India and the wisdom of our Guru-parampara. He served the mission holding key positions and spearheading several of its projects and activities. In 2006, with the endorsement of Swami Tejomayananda and the Chinmaya Mission Trust, Swamiji founded the School of Bhagavad Gita so as to effectively benefit a wider section of the population. The activities of the organization were formally inaugurated in Delhi on 1 December 2006 by Smt. Sheila Dixit with the blessings of the then President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.</p>

Under Swamiji’s direction, the publication of PIRAVI, the spiritual magazine with a difference, translations and commentaries of many renowned works, etc are done with the purpose of bringing it within the reach of the masses.</p>

			<p>The several pilgrimages (yatras) to Kailas- Manasarovar, Himalayas, Amarnath and Ganga Darshan, organized and guided by Swamiji, give a new dimension to spiritual journeys by introducing India’s cultural heritage to the common man and spreading the message of “Ishavaasyam idam sarvam”- Everything in this Universe is pervaded by the Supreme.</p>

			<p>Swami Sandeepananda Giri’s ashram, SALAGRAMAM – the Temple of Knowledge – houses the headquarters of the School of Bhagavad Gita in Thiruvananthapuram.
